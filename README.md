# Fake-News-Detectiona# üì∞ Fake News Detection using NLP & Machine Learning

This project is an AI-powered classifier that detects whether a news article is **real** or **fake**. It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and a **Passive Aggressive Classifier** trained on both real (manually created) and fake news datasets.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Fake news spreads misinformation and influences public perception. This project aims to help combat this problem by building an intelligent system that classifies news as real or fake.

---

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset is a combination of:

- ‚úÖ **Fake News**: Loaded from `Fake.csv` (Kaggle source)
- ‚úÖ **Real News**: Manually created sample articles with accurate headlines and content

| Column     | Description                           |
|------------|---------------------------------------|
| `title`    | News article title                    |
| `text`     | Full body of the news article         |
| `label`    | Target column: `FAKE` or `REAL`       |

## üß† Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- NLTK (text cleaning and stopwords)
- scikit-learn (TF-IDF, ML models, evaluation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Data Loading** (`Fake.csv` + manually written real articles)
2. **Text Cleaning** (lowercasing, stopword removal, punctuation removal)
3. **Feature Extraction** using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
4. **Model Training** using:
   - ‚úÖ Passive Aggressive Classifier
   - (You can also try SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.)
5. **Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy
   - Classification report
   - Confusion matrix
6. **Custom Prediction**:
   - You can enter your own news text and get a prediction

## üìà Model Performance

| Metric     | FAKE | REAL |
|------------|------|------|
| Precision  | 0.99 | 0.93 |
| Recall     | 0.99 | 0.92 |
| F1-Score   | 0.99 | 0.92 |
| **Accuracy** | **98.75%** overall |

üîç Even with limited real data, the model performs well thanks to TF-IDF and Passive Aggressive's effectiveness on text data.
